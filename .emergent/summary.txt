<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user has provided a new, comprehensive set of instructions to act as a SEO Local Senior Engineer + Technical SEO Specialist + CRO Expert. The goal is to correct, optimize, and restructure the epoxyart33.com website to achieve a TOP 1-3 organic ranking on Google for transactional keywords in Naples, FL.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
The user has laid out a multi-phase plan:
1.  **Phase 1 - Critical Technical Correction:** Ensure all critical SEO content (Titles, Metas, H1s, text) is rendered in the initial HTML and not dependent on JavaScript. Address PageSpeed, hidden content, and thin content issues.
2.  **Phase 2 - Winning SEO Architecture:** Implement a precise site structure with specific, keyword-optimized URLs, Meta Titles, Meta Descriptions, and H1s for the homepage and key service landing pages (Garage Flake, Metallic, Quartz/Pool Deck, Commercial, Urethane Cement).
3.  **Phase 3 - Authoritative Content:** For each service page, add detailed sections for Our Installation Process (technical details like CSP, MVB), Why EpoxyArt33, and SEO-optimized FAQs.
4.  **Phase 4 - Advanced Local SEO:** Implement , , and  Schema Markup. Ensure consistent NAP and natural use of local keywords.
5.  **Phase 5 - Strategic Interlinking:** Build a logical internal linking structure from the homepage to services and between relevant pages.
6.  **Phase 6 - Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO):** Make CTAs (Free Estimate, Call Now, Financing), guarantees, and social proof highly visible. Use locally optimized  text for all images.

The ultimate objective is to dominate the local SEO market, surpassing specific competitors mentioned by the user.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The user communicates exclusively in Spanish. The next agent **MUST** respond in Spanish.

**what currently exists?**
The agent has completed a previous SEO plan and fixed several critical deployment errors, including an incompatible Node.js engine dependency () by creating a  file and cleaning up a corrupted  file.

Following the fix, the user provided a new, much more detailed SEO and technical refactoring plan. The agent has begun implementing this new plan:
-   The main  has been updated with optimized  tags.
-    has been significantly refactored with the new H1, H2s, and a new Our Process section.
-   URLs for all key service pages have been updated in  to match the new SEO-friendly structure (e.g., ).
-   The H1s on all major service pages (, , , , ) have been updated.
-   The  has been updated with the new URLs.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was implementing the user's new, highly detailed SEO architecture (Phase 2). The last action was to update  to include all the new search-engine-friendly URLs for the service pages.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N (The agent made numerous sweeping changes to URLs and page content without a final verification test. The last screenshot taken was *before* the most recent batch of edits and revealed a blank page due to a syntax error, which was subsequently fixed. The current state is unknown.)
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent must verify that the entire site is functional after the massive URL and content refactoring. Key checks:
    1.  Homepage loads correctly.
    2.  All links in the navbar and footer work and point to the new URLs.
    3.  All major service pages (, etc.) are accessible and render content.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Site Stability After Major Refactoring (CRITICAL - P0)**
    - **Description:** The agent performed a massive refactoring of page content, component structure, and most importantly, URL routes in . There has been no testing since these changes were applied. The last time the agent ran a check after major changes, it resulted in a blank page. There is a high probability of broken links or rendering errors across the site.
    - **Attempted fixes:** None. This is a new state.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Start by taking a screenshot of the home page ().
        2.  If it fails, check the frontend supervisor logs for compilation errors (==> /var/log/supervisor/frontend.err.log <==
