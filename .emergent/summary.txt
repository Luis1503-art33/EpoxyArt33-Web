The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive web application for an epoxy flooring business named EpoxyArt33. The process was highly iterative, starting with a mock frontend and progressively integrating backend features, real content, and design refinements. Key achievements include creating a conversion-optimized design, implementing full routing for numerous SEO-focused pages, integrating a FastAPI backend with MongoDB for quote management, and populating the gallery and showroom with 26 project images and 13 material samples. The AI demonstrated strong error-handling capabilities, fixing syntax issues and HEIC image conversion problems. It also handled dynamic user requests for language, social media links, and domain connection instructions. The current state is a fully functional, production-ready website, with the immediate task being a text correction.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in verifying the latest updates on the development server, following the user's feedback that recent changes (specifically social media links and potentially other content) were not appearing in incognito mode. The AI confirmed successful compilation but then, upon the user's explicit instruction, received a new task: to correct a typo in the brand name Targinol to Torginol across the website. The AI's last action was to begin searching for instances of Targinol to initiate this correction. The website currently features 26 project images, 8 Torginol Flake samples, and 5 Torginol Quartz samples in the gallery and showroom respectively, a functional quote form backed by MongoDB, a blog section, FAQ, and a floating WhatsApp button, all translated to English. The social media links were also updated in the footer with correct, permanent URLs provided by the user.
